#### Mythril Mirror

> Mythril Mirror will be a character tracker for DND 5e. It will allow players to easily keep track of their character's current stat, xp, spells, invocations, etc.

> It's usefyul because new player's to the game often get lost when tryikng to find the appropiraite resoures for their character's race and/or class(sub-class).

> This project seeks to make the game a little easier to approach by finally filtering out spells and traits by race, class, and sub-class, without having to search 40 different websites or pay for 30 books.
